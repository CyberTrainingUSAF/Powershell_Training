# Getting help
Gaining confidence using the built-in help system is an important part of working with PowerShell. In PowerShell, help is extensive; authors can easily write their own help content when working with scripts and script modules.

A number of commands are available to interact with the help system, as follows:
```
Get-Help
Save-Help
Update-Help
```

Before exploring these commands, the concept of updatable help should be discussed.
