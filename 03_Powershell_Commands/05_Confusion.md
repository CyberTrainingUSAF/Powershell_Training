# Points to Ponder

Whenever it seems appropriate, we wrap up each chapter with a brief section that covers some of the common mistakes we see when we teach classes. The idea is to help you see what most often confuses other administrators like yourself, and to avoid those problems—or at least to be able to find a solution for them—as you start working with the shell.

# Cmdlet names

First up is the typing of cmdlet names. It’s always verb-noun, like Get-Content. All of these are options we’ll see newcomers try, but they won’t work:  
```
Get Content    
GetContent    
Get=Content    
Get_Content
```

Part of the problem comes from typos (= instead of -, for example), and part from verbal laziness. We all pronounce the command as Get Content, verbally omitting the dash. But you have to type the dash.
